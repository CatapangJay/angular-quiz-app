In this case, the sequential nature of the person_id as a primary key can lead to hotspotting because new records are continually added at the 'end' of the key space, creating a hot node which can cause performance bottlenecks. <br />• Monotonically Increasing Values: Monotonically increasing values as primary keys can exacerbate the hotspotting effect because each new entry is placed after the last, creating a write hotspot on the last node that handles the upper bound of the key range. Over time, this can lead to unbalanced read/write loads across the nodes."
